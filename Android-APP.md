## Android-APP 


Please read the API specifications for the access of the  API-data and what to display 

Then this data must be translated to the signals wished for by the clients. 

####Like in the website:
* Either a audio signal maybe a hit of a drum but it must not but it shouldnt be too nasty over time and still clearly hearable
* Or a visual change in the screen 
####More:
* Or access the flashlight to use it as signal 

Some place for personalization like placeing logos or something would be nice so it gets a little visually appealing. 

####Super Extra: 
If it would be possible to let the app control external lightning sources with 230V or 12V it would be nice if we would find a way. But maybe it is just easier to deploy this on different hardware for this perpose? Lets discuss
