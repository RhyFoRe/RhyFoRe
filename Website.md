## Website

#### It is in development

The website is using the API, and displays a visual signal. The timer for the event is just for testing purpose and reloads on every page load. 

#### DONE

The length of the singal should be 0.15 seconds, we decided for this because it makes sense to try to hit accurately the beat isnt hard at all. -- DONE 
 
* Accessing the API
* Calculate the signals for the timezone

#### TODO 

* Create a audible signal from the rhyf.mp3 in the repo 
* Create the logic to display the event timer
* Show the description
* Visual styling
