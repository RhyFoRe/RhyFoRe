## Website


Please read the API specifications for the access of the  API-data and what to display 

This service should be built in Javascript or a framework like Angular or React to put load on the clients. 

Then this data must be translated to the signals wished for by the clients. 

The length of the singal should be 0.15 seconds, we decided for this because it makes sense to try to hit accurately the beat isnt hard at all.


* Either a audio signal maybe a hit of a drum but it must not but it shouldnt be too nasty over time and still clearly hearable
* Or a visual change in the screen 

Also some place for personalization to put a logo or banner or so
